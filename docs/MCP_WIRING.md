# MCP Wiring

**Start with official servers (local-first)**
- Filesystem server: read/write project files â†” agents
- Fetch server: retrieve web pages for research/citations

**Discover more servers (Notion/Google/etc.)**
- Use curated community lists to find third-party servers for SaaS tools.

**Why MCP servers**
- Decouple integrations from agents. Agents call standardized tools; we replace or add servers without changing agent code.
